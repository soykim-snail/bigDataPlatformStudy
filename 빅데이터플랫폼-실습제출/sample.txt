[Steve Jobs remarks]
The only way to do great work.
It is just what you love to do.
If you have not found such a thing yet,
keep looking.
Do not compromise.
because,
As with everything your hear does,
When you find the job, you will know by heart.

[Grandhi remarks]
Your faith is your thought,
Your thoughts soon become words you say,
What you say is your act,
Your action soon become your habits,
Your habits soon become your values,
Your values soon become your destiny.
