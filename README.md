This repository is to keep remind the study stuff used in the class. The main topic of the class is how to construct a data platform and  how to handle the data. It includes setting a linux working network (one master machine and four slaves which are just virtual), hadoop and its eco system Spark. To handle Spark, we learned a little bit of Scala grammer and Java Lamda expression.
